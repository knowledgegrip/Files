# Document Control Management

Controlling Quality Management documents is an essential step in meeting the requirements of Quality Systems and Standards, and a practice all companies should adopt. That is why Verse Document Control was developed.
Document Control manages the creation, review, and approval of accessibility, distribution, and revisions of all business and quality management documents.
More importantly, these different types of documents can pass through a review and approval routing process that includes the Draft, Document Control Review, Review, Final Approval, Awaiting Release, and Approved. You can also control who is responsible for each step of the process, what they are allowed to edit or read in each phase, and how long they have to finish each phase.
